# Implicit-Association-Tests-IATs-

The implicit-association test (IAT) is an assessment intended to detect subconscious associations between mental representations of objects (concepts) in memory.[1] Its best-known application is the assessment of implicit stereotypes held by test subjects, such as associations between particular racial categories and stereotypes about those groups.[2] The test has been applied to a variety of belief associations, such as those involving racial groups, gender, sexuality, age, and religion but also the self-esteem, political views, and predictions of the test taker.[3][4] The implicit-association test is the subject of significant academic and popular debate regarding its validity, reliability, and usefulness in assessing implicit bias.

Welcome
You have selected the Race Task. In this study you will complete an Implicit Association Test (IAT) in which you will be asked to sort pictures and words into groups as fast as you can. In addition to the IAT, there are some questions about your beliefs, attitudes, and opinions, and some standard demographic questions. This study should take about 10 minutes to complete. At the end, you will receive your IAT result along with information about what it means.


We thank you for being here!

What Was This Study About?
In this study, you completed two Implicit Association Tests (IATs). One of them was a new IAT we're testing. That was the sorting test you completed with words and 'Civilization' and
'Nature'. We are interested in whether people find it easier to pair "Africa" and "Europe" with "Civilization" or "Nature".
During the IAT you just completed:
Your responses suggested a slight automatic association for Nature with Africa and Civilization with Europe.
Your data suggest no automatic preference between Black People and White People.
