# Implicit-Association-Tests-IATs-

The implicit-association test (IAT) is an assessment intended to detect subconscious associations between mental representations of objects (concepts) in memory.[1] Its best-known application is the assessment of implicit stereotypes held by test subjects, such as associations between particular racial categories and stereotypes about those groups.[2] The test has been applied to a variety of belief associations, such as those involving racial groups, gender, sexuality, age, and religion but also the self-esteem, political views, and predictions of the test taker.[3][4] The implicit-association test is the subject of significant academic and popular debate regarding its validity, reliability, and usefulness in assessing implicit bias.

What Was This Study About?
In this study, you completed two Implicit Association Tests (IATs). One of them was a new IAT we're testing. That was the sorting test you completed with words and 'Civilization' and
'Nature'. We are interested in whether people find it easier to pair "Africa" and "Europe" with "Civilization" or "Nature".
During the IAT you just completed:
Your responses suggested a slight automatic association for Nature with Africa and Civilization with Europe.
Your data suggest no automatic preference between Black People and White People.
